# The Game of War

This was a quick little project for the purpose of showcasing my development skills to potential employers. The current state is a little rough, but functional.

Eventually, I may put a little more polish on it. But, frankly, who wants to play War anyway? :p

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Debug logging

To see the debug logs while you are running the app, navigate to dev tools in your browser and then to local storage. Enter the following key-value pair:
